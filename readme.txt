#Summary of major findings (project-one, "Analyzing for “Hidden Patterns” in Apple’s Stock Market Data")

1. Are there certain months that are better for buying or selling Apple Stock? 
2. Does the RSI give more accurate signals on a larger timeframe than on a smaller timeframe in identifying overbought and oversold conditions for Apple stock?
3. Is it possible to do any predictive analysis based on these patterns? (linear regression/line fit?)
4. Is Apple currently overvalued or oversold based selected historical data (i.e. 2015-2017)?
